# IntelligentParkingAssistant
## Description
This project is about the reservation and allocation of the parking lots. The project is aimed to relieve the pressure of parking in Wuxi and Shanghai sites. We introduce the concept of flexible parking places to expand the capacity of the parking lot. Correspondingly, our smart parking system can help solve the problem of a vehicle blocking by intelligent reservation and allocation.

### Regular reservation
The regular reserve function is designed to allow users to make a reservation before 7:30 a.m. every day, and the system will recommend the best choice according to the available parking spaces and the duration that all reserved users have applied for. However, there is always a time when you are not satisfied with the place we recommended. You are allowed to stick to your preferred choice as long as it is still available at that time, which may possibly cause unnecessary trouble to be disturbed for moving your car. We will then adjust our recommendation options to the following users.<br>

### Temporary reservation
If you miss the regular reservation time and will arrive within 10 minutes, you are supposed to reserve temporarily. Choose the available place and confirm, our system will reserve the parking place for you in the future 10 minutes. <br><br>
In a future version, we would be possible to cooperate with other companies in the software park.When there is no spared space in our own parking lot, we may have an additional choice to take a look at those of others.<br>

### Parking status
In a future version, we would be likely to give precise guidance to the exact place.<br><br>
When you arrive at the parking lot, we recommend that you scan the QR code to cancel the reservation and confirm the parking duration. Certainly, you have the right to change the duration at any time before you leave. After completing the above process, the entire parking process is completed.<br><br>
In a future version, we may change the QR code into some IoT devices if conditions permit.<br>

After parking the car, you can devote yourselves to working with no need to worry about blocking someone else's car. We will send you a push notification in time about your vehicle blocking and blocked information, and you can also check related messages at any time. <br>
